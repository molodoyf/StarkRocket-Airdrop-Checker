# StarkRocket Airdrop Checker

 - install python 3.10
 - install libraries with <b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b>
 - fill your proxies to proxies.txt (format: http://login:password@ip:port); can work without proxies too
 - fill you wallets to wallets.txt

 Sometimes script can't work properly on some addresses.

 Maybe i will fix and update later
